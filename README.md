# Santander-customer-transaction-prediction
Santander's competition is about predicting which clients are going to make a transfer in the future. 
The available dataset is split between train and test, with 200,000 clients in each . 
There are 200 variables available (0, 199), but no information about them is given other than the numbers they hold.
we are asked to predict if a customer will make a transaction or not regardless of the amount of money transacted. 
Hence it is binary classification problem. 
In the data,the features given are numeric and anonymized.
0 indicate person doesn't make the transfer. 1 denotes person make the transfer.
